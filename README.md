# Rustic ⚙️

Rustic defines various constructs inspired by the [Rust] programming language.

Note that these are merely *inspired* by Rust, and do not necessarily map one-to-one to their
original counterparts. With that said, they do indeed share the majority of features and naming,
unless it is either againts Dart's conventions or simply impossible to implement.
